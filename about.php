            <p class="py-3">Every day, we’re surrounded by technology. As a result, coding has become an important second language for children and adults alike. Parents may find it difficult to teach programming to children if they don’t have any experience themselves. Fortunately, there are many resources available to help parents bridge that gap and provide a great learning experience for their kids. Today there are many online coding programs for kids that provide 
                the structure needed for kids to learn while being flexible enough to meet the demands of the modern family. Not only are there ample options for kids programming classes, but there are also tons of other free games, apps, and other resources that help kids learn programming skills.
